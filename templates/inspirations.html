      <br>
      <br>
      We are personal / closely related to the victims of sensitive file decryption. <br>
      <br>
      Brian: My parents had to send in a sensitive file with important credentials <br>
      to someone for them to help us, since they didn't know English very well. <br>
      As time went on, we soon realized evil intent were occuring behind the scenes. <br>
      This was vital, as they didn't have a large fortune. <br>
      <br>
      Devin: When I was trying to find a safe way to send encrypted files to my friend, <br>
      I realized others can crack them with decryption methods. That is why I tried to <br>
      make my own.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is why we decided to come together to fend off this issue for potential future victims or companies.
